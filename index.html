<p>Java Arduino Middleware (JAM) allows you to create control software for system based on Arduino platform with an high level programming language such as Java.</p>
<p>Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments. Arduino can sense the environment by receiving input from a variety of sensors and can affect its surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and other actuators. The microcontroller on the board is programmed using the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring) and the Arduino development environment (based on Processing). Arduino projects can be stand-alone or they can communicate with software running on a computer</p>
<p>Jam was born with the desire to control sensors and actuators from a source that was not the board, in particular a computer or any Java-compatible device with a network card.</p>
<p>It actually support UDP and TCP transport protocol. With UDP is possible to use a polling mode and an event-driven mode, with TCP only a polling mode; this because this middleware was developed for LAN, so the probability to lost an UDP packet is very very small. JAM is distributed in part on the computer and in part on the board and it works with a low latency because implements a messaging protocol of just 2 bytes.</p>
<p>JAM offers Java APIs for developing control software very flexible and configurable. For use it you have to download jam library form download section.
